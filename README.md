# CPP-Module
This repository is for CPP programming language learning exercises. Excellent course given by Guillaume Revyin.
Introduction, Constructors, Destructors and memory, friend and inheritance, overload and polymorphism, Multiple inheritance, STL, Containers and Iterators, Abstract types and templates and Exceptions.
# My Comment
In this project, I was introduced to OOP for the first time and learned cpp and general exercises. I learned a lot and it was a nice project. Each cpp folder is considered as a project and there are different programs in each exercise folder in them. Thank you FT.

## [ CPP 00 ](https://github.com/makbulut42/CPP-Module/tree/main/cpp00) 
### This first module of C++ is designed to help you understand the features of the language compared to C. Time to dive into object-oriented programming!
